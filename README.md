### YARN
* It was released in 2016 by Facebook, Google, and Tilde. 
* manage their dependencies more reliably
* installing their packages
* much faster than npm

<code>npm install -g yarn</code>
Instead of using 

<code>npm install --save [package-name]</code> 
you will use
<code>yarn add [package-name]</code>

To remove a dependency:
<code>yarn remove [package-name]</code>

To install all dependencies:
<code>yarn install</code> or <code>yarn</code> 

>An optional alternative for npm is Yarn
